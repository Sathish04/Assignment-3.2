Problem Statement:

1.Define matrix mymat by replicating the sequence 1:5 for 4 times and transforming into a matrix, sum over rows and columns.

> mymat<-matrix(rep(seq(5), 4), ncol = 5) 
> mymat

>apply(mymat, 1, sum)
>apply(mymat, 2, sum)

apply() function, instructs R to call a user-specified function on each of the rows or each of the columns of a matrix.

This is the general form of apply for matrices:
           apply(m,dimcode,f,fargs)
	where the arguments are as follows:
1.	m is the matrix.
2.	dimcode is the dimension, equal to 1 if the function applies to rows or 2 for columns.
3.	f is the function to be applied.
4.	fargs is an optional set of arguments to be supplied to f.
